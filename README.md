This is a repository for my final project for Anthony Donoghue's undergraduate course <i>Statistical Thinking for Data Science</i>, taken in Spring 2022 at Columbia University. The course TAs were Charlie Windolf and Daiki Tagami. The assignment was to answer any research question using hypothesis testing.

I chose to use a [Measure of America](https://measureofamerica.org/) dataset. The objective of this dataset's creation was to introduce to America the use of the human development index (HDI), a statistic composite index of wellbeing and opportunity. Among the large selection of quantitative variables in this dataset for each state, I chose to investigate the variation in infant mortality rates. My research eventually led me to add additional data, specifically the legality of slavery and the prevalence of plantations, both used as stand-in variables for structural racism. 

As I write in my conclusion, my analyses are fairly rudimentary and are being used to explore what are highly complex relationships. Even now, I can think of a number of ways in which the analyses are insufficient. All the same, the assignment was a great introduction to using data to conduct investigative research.
