# MOU-infant-mortality
Investigating variation in infant mortality rates among US states using the Measures of America dataset

This is a repository for my final project for Anthony Donoghue's undergraduate course <i>Statistical Thinking for Data Science</i>, taken in Spring 2022 at Columbia University. The course TAs were Charlie Windolf and Daiki Tagami. The assignment was to answer a research question using hypothesis testing.

I chose to use a dataset from [Measure of America](https://measureofamerica.org/) of the Social Science Research Council. The objective of this dataset's creation was to introduce to America the use of the human development index (HDI), a statistic composite index of wellbeing and opportunity. The dataset includes a large selection of quantitative variables for all 50 states. Using this dataset, I wanted to look specifically at the variation in infant mortality rates. My research eventually led me to add additional data, specifically the legality of slavery and the prevalence of plantations.
